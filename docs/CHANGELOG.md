# Changelog

## 2026-09-07 — Phase 1

### Schema
New tables, all prefixed `pl_`. No existing table is modified; nothing in the
trading platform is touched.

| Migration | Tables |
|---|---|
| `2026_09_07_000100` | `pl_tax_profiles` |
| `2026_09_07_000200` | `pl_sales_reports`, `pl_sales_report_lines`, `pl_purchase_summaries` |
| `2026_09_07_000300` | `pl_settlements` |
| `2026_09_07_000400` | `pl_audit_events` |

Migration note: all four are additive and reversible. `php artisan migrate` on a
fresh accounting database, or on a Liberu installation that has never carried
this module. `pl_audit_events` refuses updates and deletes at the model level,
so a rollback drops the table rather than editing it.

### Added
- Poland tax engine: VAT, ZUS and PIT for JDG, with versioned 2025/2026 rate
  tables carrying sources and verification dates.
- Cash-register (kasa fiskalna) sales recording, with corrections that supersede
  rather than overwrite.
- Monthly settlement report with the full derivation, legal bases, deadlines
  shifted off weekends and holidays, and explicit estimate flags.
- `bin/pl-tax` standalone CLI; `poland:report` and `poland:verify-rates` artisan
  commands; `/poland` dashboard.
- Append-only audit trail.
- `bin/check-isolation.sh`, `bin/install-foundation.sh`, nginx and systemd
  configuration, verified backup script.
- 85 tests.

### Verified
- Full test suite green on PHP 8.4.19.
- Isolation check passes clean and fails when a trading reference is introduced.
- Liberu ERP upstream `3a23437` installs with `composer install --no-dev`.

### Known
- The Liberu foundation requires PHP 8.5 to boot; see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- The Laravel layer of this module has not been executed for that reason. The
  engine underneath it is fully tested independently.
